This is the directory for the application of EEG logger application. This version is the origin of the SSVEP application.

This application is intended to fetch serial package from Arduino and log it to the logger in real time, while also compile real time FFT.

User has the option to "trigger" and start recording the information to a .csv file, for playing back the session, or for usage later using the supported tools.

There are two files, one is for single channel and the other is for dual channels.
